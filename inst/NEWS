CHANGES IN VERSION 3.5.1
-------------------------
- Fix bug : summaryMethod=‘logOfSum’, redesign for result table.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.11
-------------------------
- New functionalities : calculation of the LOD and LOQ, 1) linear_quantlim, 2) nonlinear_quantlim, 3) plot_quantlim, and two example datasets, SpikeInDataLinear, SpikeInDataNonLinear are available.
- Update for featureSelection =‘highQuality’ in dataProcess
- allow colon(“:”) in the peptide sequence
- fix the bug for ‘fill in incomplete rows’ in dataProcess. If there are only one feature has incomplete rows, the issue for getting run and feature ID in dataProcess and not show the list. Now, it works.
- change the default for blimp in dataProcessPlots for profile plot and QC plot. The upper limit of y-axis with ylimUp=FALSE is calculated by maximum log2(intensity) across all proteins after normalization + 3 and then rounding off to the nearest integer.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.10
-------------------------
- fix the bug for dataProcess
	-  When the number of proteins for $ProcessedData and $RunlevelData are different,  the bug happened for calculating %missing and imputation.
- fix the bug for groupComparison
	- when one of condition is completely missing or other special case, .fit.model.single can handle and output of .fit.model.single is not try-error. Then output for fitted and residual should be updated.



CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.9
-------------------------
- Condition plot from dataProcessPlots : Now condition plots are drawn with run-level summarized intensities per condition.
- ComparisonResult from groupComparison
	- flag about missingness and imputation : Calculation for MissingPercentage and ImputationPercentage columns is changed
		1) MissingPercentage : number of measured intensities/ total number of intensities (which is the number of features * the number of runs in a protein) in the conditions used for comparison (from ‘Label’ column) by protein. Therefore different comparisons(Label in the output) from the same protein can have the different percentage of missingness.
		2) ImputationPercentage : number of imputed intensities/total number of intensities in the conditions used for comparison (from ‘Label’ column) by protein. Therefore different comparisons(Label in the output) from the same protein can have the different percentage of imputation.
	- new column, ‘issue’, shows special cases, such as completely missing in a condition or all conditions for comparisons.
- VolcanoPlot
	- flag the proteins which have the condition with completely missing. On the left of protein name, ‘*’ willz be appeared in Volcano plot
		



CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.8
-------------------------
- normalization : overall median -> median of medians. For all workflow for MSstats, the result should not be changed. But, log(sum) will have slightly different result.
- flag about missingness and imputation
	- RunlevelData from dataProcess include two or three more columns 		
		1) NumMeasuredFeature : number of measured features in a run
		2) Missing percentage : number of measured features/total number of features by run
		3) NumImputedFeature : number of imputed intensities in a run. This column is shown only if users allow to impute the missing value.
	- ComparisonResult from groupComparison : one or two columns will be added.
		1) MissingPercentage : number of measured intensities/ total number of intensities (which is the number of features * the number of runs in a protein) by protein
		2) ImputationPercentage : number of imputed intensities/total number of intensities by protein


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.4
-------------------------
- fix the bug for featureSubset=‘highQuality’ with label-based experiment.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.3
-------------------------
- add new option, remove_proteins_with_interference=FALSE (default), in dataProcess. whether it allows to remove proteins if deem interfered or not.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.2
-------------------------
- ProteinName=TRUE in groupComparisonPlots shows only the name of significant proteins, adjusting location. ggrepel package is used.
- change featureSubset option in ‘dataProcess’ for selecting high quality features. featureSubset=‘highQuality’
- Fix the bug for ‘fillIncompleteRows=TRUE’ for label-based experiments.
- change ‘quantification’ function. use run summarization from dataProcess. If there are technical replicates, use median run summarization for each subject.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.3.1
-------------------------
- fix the bug for volcano plot in groupComparisonPlots, with logbase=2.
- update all plots for ggplot2
- Change the default for ‘cutoffCensored’. Now the default is “minFeature”.
- for imputing the censored peak intensities, remove the features which has only 1 measurement for survreg function.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.2.3
-------------------------
- bug for normalization=‘globanstandards’ in dataProcess. Even though wrong normalization options, data processing is kept going. Make the process stop if wrong input for normalization
- fix the bug with nameStandards=‘protein name’. (only peptide names worked with 3.2.2.)


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.12
-------------------------
- remove vignetter folder to remove install and build error in Bioconductor

CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.9
-------------------------
- dataProcess 
	- add options for ‘cutoffCensored=“minFeatureNRun”’.
	- summaryMethods=“TMP” : output will have ‘more50missing’column.
	- remove50missing=FALSE option : remove runs which has more than 50% of missing measurement. It will be affected for TMP, with censored option.
	- MBimpute : impute censored by survival model (AFT) with cutoff censored value
	- featureSubset option : “all”,”top3”, “highQuality”
	- change the default.
-groupComparisonPlots
	- heatmap, for logBase=10, fix the bug for setting breaks.


CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.8
-------------------------
- dataProcess : when censoredInt=“0”, intensity=0 works even though skylineReport=FALSE.
- dataProcess, with censored=“0” or “NA” : fix the bug for certain run has completely missing.
- cutoffCensored=“minRun” or “minFeature” : cutoff for each Run or each feature is little less (99%) than minimum abundance.

-summaryMethod=“TMP”, censored works. censoredInt=NA or 0, and cutoffCensored=0, minFeature, minRun

CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.3
-------------------------
- dataProcess : new option, skylineReport. for skyline MSstats report, there is ‘Truncated’ column. If Truncated==True, remove them. and keep zero value for summaryMethod=“skyline”.
- groupComparison : for skyline option, t.test, val.equal=TRUE, which is no adjustment for degree of freedom, just pooled variance.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.4
-------------------------
- Change the numbering of file name for plots. If the file names are already existing in the folder, automatically next number will be add at the end of file name. Therefore file name will not be overwritten, and we can keep all pdf files for plots.
